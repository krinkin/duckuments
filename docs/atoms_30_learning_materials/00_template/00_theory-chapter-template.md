# Chapter template {#theory-chapter-template status=ready}

Theory chapters benefit from a standardized exposition. Here, we define the template for these chapters. Rememeber to check [](#sec:documentation-manual) for a comprehensive and up-to-date list of Duckiebook supported features.

<!--

 TODO: Define new classes for:

- 'required-preliminaries' (must read, hard contraint, do not proceed if violated),
- 'recommended-preliminaries' (best if read, weak constraint, provides extra Duckiepoints)
- 'additional-reading' (for curious users, no contraint, just a pointer)
- 'lets-think' (stop and think, visual interrupt, attention regainer/grabber). -->

## Example Title: PID control {#pid-example-theory-label}

[//]: # (Start copying and pasting template from here)

Start with a brief introduction of the discussed topic, describing its place in the bigger picture, justifying the reading constraints/guidelines below. Write it as if the reader knew the relevant terminology. For example:

PID control is the simplest approach to making a system behave in a desired way rather than how it would naturally behave. It is simple because the measured output is directly feedbacked, as opposed to, e.g., the system's states. The control signal is obtained as a weighted sum of the tracking error (*P*roportional term), its integral over time (*I*ntegrative term) and its instantaneous derivative (*D*erivative term), from which the appellative of PID control. The tracking error is defined as the instantaneous difference between a reference and a measured system output.

## Problem Definition {#theory-chapter-template-problem-def}

In this section we crisply define the problem object of this chapter. It serves as a very brief recap of exactly what is needed from previous atoms as well. E.g.

Let:

\begin{align}
\dot{\state}_t = A\state_t+Bu_t \\
y = C\state_t+Du_t              \label{eq:system}
\end{align}

 be the LTI model of the Duckiebot's plant, with $x \in \statesp$, $y \in \mathbb{R}^p$ and $u \in \mathbb{R}^m$. We recall ([Duckiebot Modeling]()) that:

\begin{align}
A &= \left[  \begin{array}{ccc} a_{11}  & \dots & a_{1n} \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{n1}  & \dots & a_{nn} \end{array} \right] \\
B &= \left[ b_1 \,\, \dots \,\, b_m \right]^T \\
C &=  \left[ c_1 \ \,\, \dots \,\, c_p \right] \\
D &= 0.
\end{align}

[...]

Remember you can use the `problem` environment of $\LaTeX$ to formally state a problem:

\begin{problem}[PID]\label{prob:label-prob}
Given a system \eqref{eq:system} and measurements of the output $\tilde{y}_t = y_t + n_t, n_t \sim \cal{N}(0,\sigma)$, find a set of PID coefficients that meet the specified requirements for:
- stability,
- performance,
- robustness.
\end{problem}

as shown in ([](#figure:the-bigger-picture)).

## Introduced Notions {#theory-chapter-template-notions}

### Section 1: title-1 (e.g.: Definitions)

\begin{definition}[Reference signals]\label{def:def-label}
A reference signal $\tilde{y}_t \in \mathcal{L}_2(\mathcal{T})$ is ...
\end{definition}

[](#def-label) is very important.

<div class="check" markdown="1">

Insert 'random' checks to keep the reader's attention up:

if you can't be woken up in the middle of the night and rememeber the definition of $\mathcal{L}_2(\cdot)$, read: [](#bib:placeholder)

</div>

\begin{definition}[Another definition]\label{def:another-def-label}
Lorem
\end{definition}

### Section 2: title-2 (e.g.: Output feedback)

Now that we know what we're talking about, lets get in the meat of the problem. Here is what is happening:

\[ \cal{Lorem}
\]

### Section 3: title-3 (e.g.: Tuning the controller)

Introduce the 'synthesis through attempts' methodology (a.k.a. tweak until death)

### Section 4: title-4 (e.g.: Performance Metrics)

How do we know if the PID controller designed above is doing well? We need to define some performance metrics first:

Overshoot, Module at resonance, Settling Time, Rising Time

[...]

<div class="example-usage" markdown="1">

This is a 'think about it' interrupt, used as attention grabber:

When a Duckiebot 'overshoots', it means that [...] and the following will happen [...].

### Section N: title-N (e.g.: Saving the world with PID)

And finally, this is how you save the world, in theory.
