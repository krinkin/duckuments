# Matrix diagonalization {#matrix-diagonalization status=draft}

- singular value decomposition SVD (topic for advanced-linear-algebra?)

### Preferred spaces (matrix diagonalization)

- show how to diagonalize matrices and why it is relevant (it will come in handy for state space representation chapter chapter)


## Left and Right Inverse (topic for advanced-linear-algebra?)

- what if the matrix is not square? (topic for advanced-linear-algebra?)
- Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse




#### Example: Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors

#### Example: Find range and null spaces of a matrix
