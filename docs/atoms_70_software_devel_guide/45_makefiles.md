# Makefile system {#makefiles status=ready}

Assigned: Andrea

We use Makefiles to describe frequently-used commands.

## User guide


The command

    $ make all

displays the help for each command. This help is also included here as [](#makefiles-help).

## Makefile organization

There is one Makefile at the root of the `Software` repository, which
includes other makefiles in the directory `Makefiles/`:

    Makefile
    Makefiles/
        Makefile.build.mk
        Makefile.demos.mk
        Makefile.docker.mk
        Makefile.generate.mk
        Makefile.hw_test.mk
        Makefile.maintenance.mk
        Makefile.openhouse.mk
        Makefile.stats.mk
        Makefile.test.mk

Each child Makefile is called

    Makefile.![section].mk

and it should contain only targets of the form `![section]-![name]`.

For example, `Makefile.stats.mk` contains the targets "`stats`, `stats-easy_node`, `stats-easy_logs`".

The target called `![section]` should provide an help for the section.

For example, when you run `make build`, you see:

    ### Building commands

    Commands to build the software.

    - `make build-machines`       :  Builds the machines file.
    - `make build-machines-clean` :  Removes the machines file.
    - `make build-clean`          :  Clean everything.

The output should be valid Markdown, so that it can be included in this documentation.
