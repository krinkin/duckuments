# Camera geometry {#camera-geometry status=draft}

Assigned: Matt

Note: We could break this up into separate sub-sections for (prospective) projection and lenses.

**Topics**:

* Pinhole cameras (tie into eclipse viewing, accidental cameras)
* Geometry of projection: equations of projection; vanishing points; weak perspective; orthographic projection;
* Review of 3D transformations (translation and rotation); homogeneous transformations
* Perspective projection in homogeneous coordinates


### Lenses

* Lenses: Why?; first-order optics (thin lens); thick lens
* First-order optics (thin lens)
